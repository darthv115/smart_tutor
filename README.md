Smart Tutor - INK Makers 2017

This project is about a smart tutoring device which was developed during INK Makers make-a-thon. It is an interactive tutoring device which can be used to teach nursery kids staring out in school. This source code is to be run on Raspberry Pi 3.

It uses OCR using openCV and Artificial Neural Networks to recognise handwritten characters. The whole package comes with a RasPi, a camera, and a mini speaker. This whole package makes it the kind of interactive tutor it needs to be when it comes to teaching kids.
